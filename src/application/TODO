Applications should act as server
  - It spawns other threads running handlers other functionality

Threads act as clients
  - They request info from a channel made with application 
  - Application may then request/push something from other client or already contain info
  - Then, it returns the request or sends the push info to relevant clients
  - This is how the event handler sends data on the new pid for the tracker to know a new event has occurred

Seperate recorder and tracker
  - The recorder should request the old time from Application
